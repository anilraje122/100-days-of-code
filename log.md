1. Basic HTML and HTML5
2. Basic CSS until Attribute selectors. 


### Day 2: Sep 7, Monday 2020

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Basics of HTML & CSS are completed
2. Basic CSS until Attribute selectors. 

**Thoughts**: It was quite easy to understand the basics. but I'm exited about new concepts like CSS variables, relative units, etc.
